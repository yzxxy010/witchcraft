0.2.9更新:
        1.D到S随机消耗源力，SS和SSS可自然诞生
        2.新增冥想法与冥想法的巫力
        3.调整了升级难度与所需

主要内容：
    在生物属性下方添加：
    ①"世界源力(全局)"目前初始10000每年增加2000，低于初始值便不再增加巫师的源能
    ②"源能"巫师经验值，消耗世界源力就可转为源能
    ③"世界源力消耗/年"显示每年可多少消耗世界源力值
    巫师升级体系：学徒-正式巫师-高级巫师-大巫师-始祖，各分三阶段(升至大巫师第三阶段不死境获得不灭灵魂,可转世重修攀登始祖)
    巫师天赋体系：D-C-B-A-S，SS与SSS只可通过上帝赐予来现世
    巫师巫术体系：零环至三环，相对应学徒至大巫师，始祖随机释放三环巫术，对高于巫术等级的境界无效，比如零环不会对正式巫师生效
    在mod设置里可更改初始世界源力值与每年增加值(注意:只能输入纯数字)
    不灭灵魂复活的地方改为城市，而不是岛屿
    不灭灵魂复活次数为改为三十次
    加入突破大境界的概率(突破正式时-1源能、突破高级时-2源能、突破大巫师时-3源能),且不同天赋突破概率不同
    D天赋每年消耗由0.5削弱为0.3,C天赋每年消耗由0.7削弱为0.6
    有巫师天赋的小人在魔法之地上会获得"元素共呜"状态，每年源能+0.5
    "禁巫之族"可用来给不想让其出现巫术天赋的种族用，100%遗传

Update 0.2.9:
            1.Random source power consumption from D to S, SS and SSS can be naturally born.

            2.Added meditation methods and meditation power.

            3.Adjusted the difficulty and requirements for leveling up.

Add under creature attributes:
    ①"World Origin Power (Global)" currently starts at 10000 and increases by 2000 annually. If it is lower than the initial value, it will no longer increase the wizard's origin power.
    ②"Origin ability" Wizard experience points, consumption of world origin energy can be converted to origin ability
    ③"World Source Power Consumption/Year" shows how much World Source Power can be consumed every year.
    Sorcerers upgrade system: Apprentice-Official Sorceress-Advanced Sorceress-Grand Sorceress-Ancestor, each divided into three stages (upgrade to Grand Sorceress Stage 3 Immortal Realm to obtain Immortal Soul, reincarnate to upgrade to Ancestor)
    Sorcery Talent System: D-C-B-A-S, SS and SSS can only be created by God
    Sorcery system: Zero ring to three rings, corresponding to apprentice to great sorcery. The ancestor randomly releases three rings of sorcery, which is ineffective against realms higher than sorcery level. For example, zero ring will not be effective against official sorcerers.
    In mod settings, you can change the initial world source power value and the annual increment value (note: only enter pure numbers)
    The place where immortal souls are resurrected is changed to a city instead of an island.
    Undying souls resurrected 30 times instead
    Add the probability of breaking through to a major realm (-1 origin ability when breaking through to an official realm,-2 origin ability when breaking through to an advanced realm,-3 origin ability when breaking through to a great wizard), and the probability of breaking through varies with different talents.
    D cost reduced from 0.5 to 0.3 per year, C cost reduced from 0.7 to 0.6 per year
    Minions with wizard talent will gain "Elemental Resonance" status in Magic Land, annual origin ability +0.5
    "Forbidden Witch Clan" can be used on races that do not want their magic talents to appear. 100% inherited.
